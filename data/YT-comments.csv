"This is a about as perfect a coverage of this topic as I could imagine. I'm a researcher with a PhD in NLP who trains LLMs from scratch for a living and often find myself in need of communicating the process in a way that's digestible to a broad audience without back and forth question answering, so I'm thrilled to have found your piece! As an aside, I think the token order on the y-axis of the attention mask for decoders on slide 10 is reversed",Thanks Sean! It's always a challenge to convey technical information in a way that both the researcher and general  audience can get value from. So your approval means a lot :) Thanks for pointing the out. The blog article has a corrected version: https://medium.com/towards-data-science/how-to-build-an-llm-from-scratch-8c477768f1f9?sk=18c351c5cae9ac89df682dd14736a9f3
This was a very thorough introduction to LLMs and answered many questions I had. Thank you.,"Great to hear, glad it was helpful :)"
Thank you so much for putting these videos together and this one in particular. This is such a broad and complex topic and you have managed to make it as thorough as possible in 30ish minuteüòÆ timeframe which I thought was almost impossible.,"My pleasure, glad it was informative yet concise :)"
Honestly the most straightforward explanation I've ever watched. Super excellent work Shaw. Thank you. It's so rare to find good communicators like you!,"Thanks, glad it was clear "
"Wow dude, just you wait, this channel is gonna go viral! You explain everything so clearly, wish you led the courses at my university.",Thanks for the kind words! Maybe one day 
"Hi, what PCA data specifically did you put into ICA? Did you take the variable loadings of each of the 21 PCs? Was that your data frame? I am trying to do this for financial data, would be awesome if you took the output of your PCA video and ran ICA on top of that","Hey, thanks for the question! The transformed EEG signals (i.e. 21 principal components) are what are fed into the ICA function. The data structure is an array where rows correspond to time points and columns to each of the principal components. That sounds like a cool idea! It should be simple to implement. If you are using sklearn, you can use a X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X) to get the transformed data, then a X_ica = ica.fit_transform(X_pca) to apply ICA to the principal components. PCA: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html#sklearn.decomposition.PCA ICA: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.FastICA.html Hope that helps!"
"Hi Shawhin, thank you for the clear explanation about ICA I tried your code without any modifications and every time I ran the script, the results are different. Like everytime the resulting signal without blink is different in shape and amplitude, is that normal? Also, when I plot the original data (64 channels) vs the resulting data_noblink, each channel is not consistent regarding its positions (like data from channel 1 (Data(:,1)) is now in Data(:,6) and so on. My question is, is there a random effect of using ICA that I didn't catch when inverse PCA transform happens? if so, can I use a seed or similar to control this randomness?","Great question. The ICA implementation here introduces randomness into the code. Quickly skimming the MATLAB doc, it's not immediately obvious how one can control it, but I have provided the link below for you reference. https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/rica.html#bvnjjp8-5 Hope that helps!"
"10/10 video, no nonsense, no random personal opinions or bias. Thanks!","Thanks, glad u liked it :)"
"This tutorial has been very helpful! One question - how did you create the assets/img folder in your portfolio repository? The only option I'm seeing is to Add a File, but not an option to create a folder so I can create one for the assets and images.","Good question! When you hit ‚ÄúAdd a File‚Äù, you can prepend the filename with the path e.g. assets/img/headshot.png"
Ive had a class on Neurotech and they did not explain any of this but expected me to write a program using ICA feature selection. I found nothing usefull until this video. thank you so much,I was in a similar situation. That‚Äôs a big reason for this video. Glad it was helpful!
"Very clear, thanks! The examples with the mic and blinks were a great inclusion imo. They made ICA much easier to understand while also displaying the practical application in a fun way :)",Glad it was helpful!
"you explained totally wrong, and waist my time.","I‚Äôm sorry, which parts are wrong?"
Awesome video ... never knew wavelets were this powerful.,"Definitely, they are a great thing to have in the toolbox. Thanks for your comment!"
"Epic, very useful for my BCI class","Thanks, glad to hear!"
"Hi , Shawhin talebi  I didn't understand what are those scales you plot next to the ECG signal and what is their relationships with coefficients T(m,n) in the mathematical formula","Hi Momomt, thanks for your question! T(m,n) is the coefficient corresponding to the basis wavelet with scale m and location n. Scale sets how ""stretched"" or ""squished"" the wavelet is, while the location sets where the wavelet is positioned. The first plot shown in the example, shown these coefficents for each choice of scale (e.g. 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, ...) and each choice of location i.e. time (x-axis). I hope the clears things up!"
"Hi , I have a question, does this woks on ECG signal that are ""changing""?  Like CPET(Cardio- pulmonary Exercise Testing)  for example. Those ECG contains three stage, resting phase -> exercise phase -> recovery phase, So the heartbeat rate should be changing a lot, will MODWT still work on these kind of data?","That‚Äôs a good question! The short answer is yes. Ultimately it comes down to what you are after. If it is to find r peaks, like we did here, it shouldn‚Äôt be an issue. Hope that helps!"
Do you think I should use Wavelet Transform for EEG (electroencefalogram) data or should I use Fast fourier Transform? how do you chose? Thanks for the video and the code.,"The answer to your question is yes. Both are good! Each extract different information. Wavelet transform does a good job at capturing localized oscillations (like a blip or a chirp) in time series. FFT is great at getting global frequency information, meaning oscillations that persist over the whole signal. You can also ""chop up"" your EEG signals into epochs in which you perform an FFT, or even further, do sliding window over the entire signal and compute the FFT at each instance. Hope that helps!"
"hi sir, what does 4  means in sym4 is there  any special  meaning  behind numbers in  wavelets Eg:  sym1,sym2,....,Db1,Db2,...","That's a good question, cause I had to look it up. According to wikipedia, for Daubechies wavelets the number in db1 refers to the number of vanishing moments. For Symlets, these are created from Daubechies wavelets so I assume sym4 means it is generated from the db4 wavelet."
Thank you very much for this playlist! I'm doing my bachelor thesis on Learning Causal Structures form observational data and your videos are a great introdution.,Wow that's so cool! Glad the videos were helpful. Good luck on your thesis 
Thank you for the Great video! I have a question on how to learn DAG when the variables in the data are continuous not just discrete (Boolean or categorical)?,"Thanks for the question! The techniques I discussed here should work for both continuous and discrete data. However, we can always discretize a continuous variable through binning or breaking down it into quantiles."
"This is really great :-) I wonder though if it works for time-series and one-time events. For example, can you infer the effect of an event (a tweet from Bidon) to an uprise of S&P index?",I can see it working for time series after a little data preparation. One-time events feel more challenging but I‚Äôm sure there is something out there for those too.
In GES algorithm how are the direction of the edges determined?,"Hi Oiendrila, thanks for your question! GES starts with an empty graph (i.e. nodes with no edges), then directed edges are iteratively added based on some choice of score (e.g. BIC). So unlike the PC algorithm, there is no need to oriented edges as an extra step. Hope that helps!"
Are there metrics to validate causal models built through causal discovery?,"Hi Rohan, thanks for the question! The short answer is yes. This is what is used for Trick 2, where your validation metric serves as a score. One I have come across is the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which is mentioned briefly in reference [1] on slide 6. However, I am sure there are others out there. Now, the nuanced answer depends on what you mean by validate. Generally we do not know the true DAG that describes our system of interest. In such cases, we have to be careful about how we evaluate the efficacy of the DAG, since we have no ground truth from which to compare. For example, BIC balances the DAG's ability to generate the underlying data with a penalty for the number of parameters (i.e. nodes and edges). Hope that helps!"
"""If you give someone a graduate degree it's not going to have any affect on their age"" My grey hairs beg to differ!",Lol üòÇ üòÇ
"So based on the example in this video I think I can reasonably conclude that all 3 casual discovery ""ticks"" are more or less garbage at finding causal DAGs.","That‚Äôs fair, it‚Äôs still early for these types of techniques. In my experience, I‚Äôd say most approaches don‚Äôt give nice results for most problems out of the box. It typically takes a little TLC and insight to make things work well."
Thanks for spending the money! :D These are some valuable tips!,Glad to hear. It was worth it then üòÅ
Data science final year project can u please give me ideas like it should be demand in industry as well,"It's impossible to give a good recommendation without more details. Feel free to book ""Office Hours"" with me and we can discuss further: https://calendly.com/shawhintalebi/office-hours"
"I rather use the proper term ""Expert System.""","That plays a large role when putting AI into practice. However, my understanding is ""expert systems"" rely solely on rule-based systems rather than machine learning."
"Hi Shaw, a very crisp and clear video.",Thanks Sanjay! Glad it was clear :)
"So broken down and easy to understand! Thank you Shaw, super helpful for AI-dummies like me!",Glad it was clear and helpful!
"Thanks for sharing, indeed with experience these questions appeared more natural to ask eventually. And I agree with 'not reinventing' the wheel, and ask the customer what they tried already and why it failed or partly succeeded only. This is really good","Thanks, glad you liked it :)"
I've been in IT consulting for 35 years and I haven't heard a better summary of how to initiate a successful client relationship.,Wow thanks for kind feedback. Any questions or notes you'd add to the list based on your experience?
Mr. Moneybags ova here!,üòÇüòÇü§ë
"The best way to make money with data science I think is to make your own ML saas products and build them in public. It'll attract people to you who are developing similar things and could use your help. This can turn into either a job, freelance clients, or you get rich on your own. It takes a long time to do this though, but I'm doing it, so we'll see what happens.","Thanks for the comment! That‚Äôs an awesome idea and the longer term goal. Even if what I build fails, I can still make videos about it and hopefully provide value to those building similar things üòé"
great as usual! fat tail analysis sounds very much like analysis of scale-free networks!,Thanks! Glad you liked it :) That's not surprising. Mark E. J. Newman who wrote book on Networks is a co-author on the paper for the powerlaw library used here.
"Audios a bit quiet on this one. This series is great though, thanks shaw","Sorry about that, I guess I rushed this one a bit üòÖ"
Big respect for taking the leap!,Thanks üòÖ I hope sharing my journey is helpful to those contemplating something similar.
I wish you the best my friend and excited to follow this. Would love to chat more and exchange tips as I've done the same thing :),"Thanks Louis! Absolutely, looking forward to learning from you"
"Wow amazing and inspiring! I'm an entrepreneur from Colombia who wants to generate extra income . I currently run a bar which I have managed for 19 years and although I love it, I need to leverage my income and I see huge potential within AI. I have explored learning botpress or maybe RAG but I am not sure if thats the right path or if maybe there are some better oppirtunities. I have no code knowledge but strong experience as an entrepreneur and selling skills. I love your content and and insight you may throw would be worthed . Best energy in you entrepreneurial journey!","Thanks for the kind words, I‚Äôm glad the video was valuable :) Same to you! It‚Äôs just a matter of effort and patience"
Addicted to this channel.,I hope it's one of those good addictions üòÖ
Nice to hear about this idea is such a short video which took Taleb volumes and most of readers like us never getting that this is what he was talking about üòú,üòÇüòÇ The volumes are usually a prerequisite for a more concise description. Most of this video is me parroting things I learned from Taleb.
"At 4:22 what exactly is x and what is P(X=x)? In the Gaussian example I would expect x to be wealth that increases from left to right and y to be the number of observations. Yet with that in mind, shouldn't the Pareto curve be such that x=w from low to high, with at the bottom a lot of observations and only very few at the high end of wealth? How is it that it typically explained that the 20% of the bottom end of the x-axis have 80% of everything?","Good question. Supposing wealth follows the given Pareto distribution, X could be net worth and P(X=x) is the probability that a random selection from the population will have net worth equal to x. The long tail here reflects the intuition that there are many more people with net worths around $100,000 than $100,000,000, since the as x increases P(X=x) decreases. The 80-20 rule comes in when you add up all the wealth of to the top 20%, you would get about 80% of the total wealth in the population. Hope that clears things up, happy to expand on any point."

"So many of your videos really resonate with my experience as a traditional data scientist exploring LLMs.  Your ""at first I thought prompt engineering was bunk"" is definitely my journey as well.  I find this to be super highly related to your previous video where you said potentially 95% of use cases can be covered by generalized pre-trained models or fine-tuned models.  These models are truly so powerful that the secret sauce is in 1.) choosing the right pre-trained base model 2.) asking it the right questions in an efficient way.  Thanks so much for all your work in putting together this content, I find it some of the best-explained LLM content on the interwebs",Thanks for the kind words. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre enjoying the content. More to come!
Thank you! Awesome content and excellent presentation. Sincerely appreciated,Glad you liked it!
Your videos are great man; I hope your channel grows.  Quick question: Langchain seems very integrated with OpenAI's API and software packages; have you tried using Langchain with an open-sourced free of charge LLM?  Thanks!  I am trying to build an LLM based app for a portfolio for PhD application in AI.,"Thanks for the kind words, I'm glad you like the videos. While I've only used LangChain with OpenAI's API, it is has integrations with many other LLM providers. Here's more on how to use it with HF: https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/huggingface"
"Can you do a video on finetuning a multimodal LLM (Video-LlaMA, LLaVA, or CLIP)  with a custom multimodal dataset containing images and texts for relation extraction or a specific task? Can you do it using open-source multimodal LLM and multimodal datasets like video-llama or else so anyone can further their experiments with the help of your tutorial. Can you also talk about how we can boost the performance of the fine-tuned modal using prompt tuning in the same video?",Thanks for the suggestion! Multi-modal models are an exciting next step for AI research. I added it to my list.
how can you avoid prompt escape / jailbreak in response?,That's an important (and technical) question. Here is a nice write up on prompt injection: https://llmtop10.com/llm01/

"Another response from you please. 1) How is LLM related to robotics? Is LLM used in or a part of robotics? 2) If LLM is used in robotics, can LLM be fine-tuned every time the robot's task is modified or changed? 3) Can an app made with the help of LLM be used instead to control, program and modify the movements of robot?","1) These are different technologies, however there will surely be interesting use cases combining the two. 2) While this depends on the details of the use case, LLMs can in principle learn from feedback (i.e. reinforcement learning) 3) I'm sure this is possible, however it's unclear whether it would yield in better results than existing approaches Thanks for all the interesting questions!"
"Hi Shaw, Super clear explanation, I was wondering if I can request an explanation on how exactly use LangChain ""effectively""? The benefits and limitations, or are there other options to ""combined"" every state-of-the-art of each models are there in one place? (Like an open source text gen (mixtral 8x7b), image gen(fooocus), audio and video gen in one place of a chatbot interface)?","Glad it was clear and thanks for the suggestion! I'm planning 3 more videos for this series, and I'll definitely keep these in mind :)"
Can I earn by creating LLMs or fine tuning,If your model solves a problem people are willing to pay for then yes. But this often requires more than just a model.

"One question: Before estimating an effect, you have to construct the DAG. Isn't it? Which variables/nodes from the DAG are the covariates (Z)? Or you just include every other variable available?",That‚Äôs a good question. I would recommend constructing a DAG as a first step to any causal analysis but it is not strictly required for these regression-based techniques. I would be cautious about (blindly) including all other available variables in the analysis. My intuition on this is it comes down to Berkson‚Äôs paradox. There is a nice write up by Judea pearl on this issue: https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r348.pdf This is one reason why a DAG is helpful
"Hi, Nice tutorial. I have a question. Is it possible to have more than 1 output in a supervised way? For example: {""input"": ""ddddddd"", ""output1"":""dddd"",""eeee"", ""ffffff"", ""output2"": ""xxxx"", ""zzzzz"", etc} Thx","Good question. I'd say it depends on the use case and the meaning of the outputs. However, here are 2 thoughts. 1) concatenate ""output1"" and ""output2"" to make ""output"" e.g. ""output1"":""dddd"",""eeee"", ""ffffff"" + ""output2"": ""xxxx"", ""zzzzz"", = ""output"":""dddd"", ""eeee"", ""ffffff"", ""xxxx"", ""zzzzz"" 2) train 2 models, one for ""output1"" and another for ""output2"" Hope that helps!"
"Hello , Thanks . Do you know is it possible to create an own LLM  for own startup?","Of course this is possible. However, it is rarely necessary. I'd suggest seeking simpler (and cheaper) solutions before jumping to training an LLM from scratch."
"Hi, how long did it take you to you to fintune Mistral in this example?",Took about 10 min to run in Colab
is text embedding same as text tokenization done in training ?,"Good question! These are different things. Tokenization is the process of taking a some text and deriving a vocabulary from which the original text can be generated, where each element in the vocabulary is assigned a unique integer value. Text embeddings on the other hand, take tokens and translate them into meaningful (numerical) representations. I talk a little more about tokenization here: https://youtu.be/czvVibB2lRA?si=FwqmkB9Ltyq45n0w&t=348"
"Rag is great for semi-static or static content as knowledge base, but which path do you use for dynamic, time-relevant data like current sales from a database?","That's a great question. The short answer is RAG can handle this sort of data (at least in principle). The longer answer involves taking a step back and asking oneself ""why do I want to use RAG/LLMs/AI for this use case?"" This helps get to the root of the problem you are trying to solve and hopefully give more clarity about potential solutions."
Hey Shaw - Great video. But there are also an AI Engineer role & AI Product Manager roles. Where does it fit in?,"Great question. AI Engineer seems to be a new one. I've mainly seen this from data science or ML engineering freelancers rebranding themselves for a non-technical audience. So they will likely have a similar skillset to a full-stack data scientist (as I describe it here). The AI Product Manager is one step beyond a full-stack data scientist in that they implement products rather than projects. This requires additional considerations such as sales, marketing, finding product market fit, and other business skills."
"I discovered your channel yesterday and I am hucked, great job. It would be nice to see a video of fine tuning ShawGPT using HF, I saw a video you did running on Colab using Mistal-7b, any chance to do a video using your laptop (Mac) or using HF spaces?",Thanks for the great suggestions! The QLoRA video uses HF to implement another version of ShawGPT using Colab. I plan on doing a future video on local fine-tuning on Mac with Llama3.
